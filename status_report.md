**Phase 1 – Environment Setup (Day 1–2)**
- Completed: Plaid sandbox access, local backend/front-end environment, n8n instance
- Completed: Discord webhook configured and tested (alerts online)

**Phase 2 – Data Pipeline (Day 3–5)**
- Completed: Plaid webhooks flowing through n8n ? GuardDog
- Pending: FastAPI log ingestion feed
- Pending: OpenAI usage tracking feed

**Phase 3 – Compliance Checks (Day 6–8)**
- Completed: Added Python compliance scanner (credit card + SSN regex, high-volume transaction detection) consuming JSON rule config
- Completed: Ensured compliance rules live in `server/config/complianceRules.json`
- Pending: Integrate Python scanner into automated pipeline / expand datasets

**Phase 4 – Alerting & Reporting (Day 9–11)**
- Completed: Discord alerts operational; Notion logging and Slack automation remain optional future work

**Phase 5 – LLM Risk Control (Day 12–14)**
- Baseline LLM scanner already in place; no new middleware added this phase

Current focus: extend Phase 2 feeds (FastAPI logs, OpenAI usage) and connect the new Python compliance scanner into the real-time workflow.

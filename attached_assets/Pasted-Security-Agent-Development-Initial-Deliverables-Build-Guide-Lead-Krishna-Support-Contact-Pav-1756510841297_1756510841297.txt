Security Agent Development – Initial Deliverables & Build Guide
Lead: Krishna
Support Contact: Pavan (n8n integration)
Prepared by: Caleb Kioh

Purpose
Develop an AI-powered Security Agent that continuously audits Walletgyde’s workflows and flags compliance anomalies, supporting GDPR, CCPA, and SOC2-aligned standards. This agent will help maintain a strong security posture as we scale Walletgyde AI and integrate financial APIs.

Immediate Deliverables (First 2 Weeks)
Week
Task
Description
1
Onboarding & Access Setup
- Join Notion, GitHub, and Slack.- Review existing compliance documentation.- Complete security onboarding checklist.- Review the Compliance Standards Doc you authored for context.
1
Policy Review + Initial Drafting
- Audit our current internal privacy/security protocols.- Draft a structured policy outline highlighting areas where the Security Agent can automate monitoring or reporting.
2
Security Agent Research & Prototype
- Research and outline the technical blueprint for the Security Agent.- Begin prototyping core features: 1. Audit logs for API activity. 2. Alerts for unusual access patterns. 3. Data classification scanning for sensitive information leaks.- Integrate compliance checklists into the agent logic.
2
LLM Risk Analysis
- Review how LLMs handle memory, prompt history, and potential hallucinations in sensitive contexts.- Identify risk mitigation techniques for financial and personal data.- Draft a “LLM Privacy & Risk Controls” section to add to our compliance guide.


How to Build the Security Agent
1. Core Functions
The Security Agent should:
Monitor API calls (Plaid, OpenAI, internal CRM).


Flag anomalies (e.g., spikes in data pulls, unusual IP activity).


Classify sensitive data (detect PII, financial account numbers, SSNs in logs).


Audit compliance adherence (GDPR consent checks, SOC2 logging).


Trigger automated alerts (via Slack, Email, or n8n webhook).



2. Technical Architecture
Data Ingestion Layer


Pull logs from Plaid API, OpenAI API, FastAPI backend logs.


Use n8n workflows to collect and normalize data streams.


Detection & Classification Layer


Use Python scripts with regex & spaCy/NLP to detect PII or sensitive keywords.


Apply AI classification (OpenAI or Claude API) for edge cases.


Compliance Rule Engine


Store rules in JSON (e.g., "max_api_calls_per_hour": 1000).


If a rule is broken, pass event to the Action Layer.


Action Layer


For critical events → Send Slack alert (via n8n).


For minor warnings → Add to weekly compliance digest.



3. Step-by-Step Build Plan
Phase 1 – Environment Setup (Day 1–2)
Get access to Plaid sandbox & backend logs.


Set up n8n workflow editor account.


Connect Slack API to n8n for automated alerts.


Phase 2 – Data Pipeline (Day 3–5)
Create n8n nodes for:


Plaid API pull (transaction & metadata).


Backend log ingestion (FastAPI logs).


AI API call tracking (OpenAI usage logs).


Phase 3 – Compliance Checks (Day 6–8)
Write Python function to scan text/log data for:


Credit card patterns (regex).


SSN patterns.


High-volume transaction pulls.


Store compliance rules in JSON config file.


Phase 4 – Alerting & Reporting (Day 9–11)
If a compliance rule is broken:


Trigger Slack alert (for real-time issues).


Write incident to a Notion incident log via n8n.


Phase 5 – LLM Risk Control (Day 12–14)
Add middleware that checks all outbound LLM responses for:


Disallowed financial advice.


Unverified data sources.


If violation found → rewrite or block the response before sending to user.



Collaboration
Pavan – Currently working on n8n automations.


Meet with Pavan to review how existing n8n workflows handle API events.


Adapt his workflow templates to Security Agent triggers.
